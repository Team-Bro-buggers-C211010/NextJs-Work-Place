📘 Notes on Route Groups in Next.js (App Router)
==============================

✅ What Are Route Groups?
------------------------------
Route Groups let you organize routes without affecting the URL structure. 
You define a route group using parentheses in the folder name, like:

  app/
    (auth)/
      login/
        page.tsx

URL: http://localhost:3000/login

Note: The "(auth)" part is NOT visible in the URL.

------------------------------
🧠 Why Use Route Groups?
------------------------------
- Organize routes cleanly without changing URLs
- Apply different layouts to different groups
- Maintain better separation between app sections
- Share layouts/providers in isolated sections

------------------------------
📁 Folder Structure Example:
------------------------------
app/
  (dashboard)/
    layout.tsx        ← Dashboard Layout
    home/
      page.tsx        ← http://localhost:3000/home
  (auth)/
    layout.tsx        ← Auth Layout
    login/
      page.tsx        ← http://localhost:3000/login
    register/
      page.tsx        ← http://localhost:3000/register

------------------------------
🧱 Use Case: Layout Separation
------------------------------
You can define a separate layout for each group:

- app/(auth)/layout.tsx → Auth layout
- app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx → Dashboard layout

Only the files inside each group are wrapped with that layout.

------------------------------
🤹 Nesting Route Groups
------------------------------
Yes, route groups can be nested:

  app/
    (app)/             ← Authenticated app group
      (settings)/
        page.tsx

URL remains: /settings

------------------------------
🧩 Route Groups + Parallel Routes
------------------------------
Route groups work well with parallel routes.

Example:
  app/
    dashboard/
      @analytics/(analytics)/page.tsx
      @inbox/(inbox)/page.tsx

This enables rendering different sections (slots) in parallel with shared layouts.

------------------------------
⚠️ Important Notes:
------------------------------
- Route groups are only for the App Router (app directory)
- They do not change the URL
- You can define layouts, templates, or error boundaries inside a route group

------------------------------
📝 Summary:
------------------------------
- Use parentheses: (groupName)
- Organize routes without changing URLs
- Helpful for layout separation
- Compatible with parallel routes
