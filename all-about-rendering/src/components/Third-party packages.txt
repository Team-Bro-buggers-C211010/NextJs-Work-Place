## Third-party packages

Server Components have introduced an exciting new paradigm in React, and the
ecosystem is evolving to keep up

Third-party packages are starting to add the "use client" directive to components
that need client-side features, making it clear where they should run

Many npm packages haven't made this transition yet

This means while they work fine in Client Components, they might break or fail
completely in Server Components

We can wrap the third-party components that need client-side features in our own
Client Components
