## Client-only code

Just like how we need to keep certain operations server-side, it's equally crucial to
keep some functionality strictly on the client side

=> Client-only code works with browser-specific features - think DOM manipulation,
window object interactions, or localStorage operations

These features aren't available on the server, so we need to make sure such code
runs only on the client side to avoid server-side rendering errors

=> To prevent unintended server side usage of client side code, we can use a
package called "client-only"
