## Streaming (Familiar with Suspense in React)

Streaming is a strategy that allows for progressive UI rendering from the server

Work is broken down into smaller chunks and streamed to the client as soon as
they're ready

This means users can see parts of the page right away, without waiting for
everything to load

It's particularly powerful for improving initial page load times and handling UI
elements that depend on slower data fetches, which would normally hold up the
entire route

Streaming comes built right into the App Router
