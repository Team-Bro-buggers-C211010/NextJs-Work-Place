📘 Dynamic Rendering in Next.js

Definition:
Dynamic rendering is a server rendering strategy where HTML is generated uniquely at request time, rather than during the build. This is essential for delivering personalized content to users.

✅ When to Use Dynamic Rendering

Use it when:
- You need to access data only available at request time, such as:
  - Cookies
  - Request headers
  - URL search parameters
- You want to show user-specific or session-based content.

Examples:
- News websites
- Personalized shopping/product pages
- Social media feeds

⚙️ How Dynamic Rendering Works in Next.js

Next.js automatically switches to dynamic rendering for a route when it detects usage of a dynamic function/API, such as:
- cookies()
- headers()
- draftMode()
- searchParams prop
- after()
- connection()

Using any of the above will opt the entire route into dynamic rendering.

🔧 Forcing Dynamic Rendering

If you want to explicitly force a route to render dynamically, use:

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

Place it at the top of your route file (e.g., inside your page.tsx or page.jsx file).

📝 Summary

- Dynamic rendering generates HTML on each request.
- It's automatically enabled in Next.js when dynamic functions are used.
- Ideal for personalized or session-specific content.
- No need to manually choose between static and dynamic — Next.js does it intelligently.
- You can force dynamic rendering using the `dynamic` export.
