generateStaticParams()

generateStaticParams is a function that (SSG)

- works alongside dynamic route segments
- to generate static routes during build time
- instead of on demand at request time
- giving us a nice performance boost

Multiple dynamic route segments

Suppose we have a product catalog with categories and products

/products/[category]/[product]/page.tsx

export async function generateStaticParams () {
return [
{ category: "electronics", product: "smartphone" },
{ category: "electronics", product: "laptop" },
{ category: "books", product: "science-fiction" },
{ category: "books", product: "biography" },

1;
}
